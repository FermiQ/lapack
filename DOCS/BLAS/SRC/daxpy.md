# `daxpy.f` - Double Precision AXPY (alpha*X + Y)

## Overview

This file implements the `DAXPY` subroutine, a Level 1 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) routine. It computes the operation `dy = da * dx + dy`, where `dx` and `dy` are vectors and `da` is a scalar. This operation is fundamental in many matrix and vector computations. The implementation uses unrolled loops for efficiency when vector increments are equal to one.

## Key Components

### 1. `SUBROUTINE DAXPY(N, DA, DX, INCX, DY, INCY)`
   - **Description:** Computes `dy = da * dx + dy`.
   - **Parameters/Arguments:**
     - `N`: (INTEGER) The number of elements in the vectors `DX` and `DY`.
     - `DA`: (DOUBLE PRECISION) The scalar multiplier `alpha`.
     - `DX`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array) The input vector `x`. Dimension `( 1 + ( N - 1 )*abs( INCX ) )`.
     - `INCX`: (INTEGER) The storage spacing between elements of `DX`. If `INCX` is 1, `DX` elements are contiguous.
     - `DY`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array) The input vector `y`, which is overwritten with the result. Dimension `( 1 + ( N - 1 )*abs( INCY ) )`.
     - `INCY`: (INTEGER) The storage spacing between elements of `DY`. If `INCY` is 1, `DY` elements are contiguous.
   - **Returns:** The result is stored in the `DY` array.

## Important Variables/Constants

- This file primarily uses its input arguments to control behavior. Local variables like `I`, `IX`, `IY`, `M`, `MP1` are loop counters or temporary indices.
- The routine has early exit conditions:
    - If `N <= 0`, it returns immediately.
    - If `DA == 0.0`, it returns immediately (as `0*DX + DY = DY`).

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Basic DAXPY usage in Fortran**
```fortran
PROGRAM TEST_DAXPY
  IMPLICIT NONE
  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: N = 5
  DOUBLE PRECISION :: DA
  DOUBLE PRECISION :: DX(N), DY(N)
  INTEGER :: I

  ! Initialize vectors and scalar
  DA = 2.0
  DO I = 1, N
    DX(I) = DBLE(I)      ! DX = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
    DY(I) = DBLE(I*10)   ! DY = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0]
  END DO

  ! Call DAXPY with unit increments
  ! DY = DA*DX + DY
  ! DY = 2.0 * [1,2,3,4,5] + [10,20,30,40,50]
  ! DY = [2,4,6,8,10] + [10,20,30,40,50]
  ! DY = [12,24,36,48,60]
  CALL DAXPY(N, DA, DX, 1, DY, 1)

  PRINT *, 'Result DY:'
  PRINT *, (DY(I), I=1,N)

END PROGRAM TEST_DAXPY
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Internal Dependencies:**
  - None beyond standard Fortran intrinsics (e.g., `MOD`).
- **External Libraries:**
  - This is a core BLAS routine. It does not depend on other BLAS or LAPACK routines.
- **Called By:**
  - `DAXPY` is a fundamental routine used extensively by higher-level BLAS (Level 2 and 3) and LAPACK routines for performing matrix factorizations, solving linear systems, eigenvalue computations, etc. (e.g., in routines like `DGESV`, `DGEMV`, etc.)
- **Calls To:**
  - None.
